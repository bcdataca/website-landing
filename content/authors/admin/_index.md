The bcdata initiative is a collaborative effort to build a vibrant community
intertwining people from government, industry, universities and not-for-profits
toward three goals:

1. Share knowledge and identify opportunities emerging from the data explosion,
1. Develop training experiences and career pathways for young mathematical
scientists (mathematicians, statisticians, computer scientists) and support
organizations in recruiting talent,
1. Forge long-term research and development partnerships to improve society and
advance industry in British Columbia.

The bcdata community meets monthly for the bcdata colloquium, a networking
event with presentations on various data science topics.  The initiative also
hosts problem solving workshops in the summer, where government, industry, and
not-for-profit partners are invited to contribute challenge problems and
collaborate with interdisciplinary teams of students and university
researchers. The [2017](http://workshop.bcdata.ca/2017/) and
[2018](http://workshop.bcdata.ca/2018/), workshops have catalyzed long-term
research and development partnerships within the bcdata community.

[Avigilon (a Motorola Solutions Company)](http://avigilon.com/), the [Pacific
Institute for the Mathematical Sciences (PIMS)](https://www.pims.math.ca) and
the [Canadian Statistical Sciences Institute (CANSSI)](http://canssi.ca) are
proud to sponsor the 2019-2020 bcdata colloquium series in Vancouver. Other sponsors are welcome to join.

**Location:** Avigilon Corporation Atrium, [555 Robson St, Vancouver](https://goo.gl/maps/6mHjCucr32sv4jv97) (Robson at Seymour)

**Registration:** 18:00 

**Talk:** 18:30 (Refreshments served: 19:30 onwards)

**Abstract:**
The wind industry is increasingly moving towards data-driven control and operations. In this talk, we look at key challenges in the area, the kind of data we get from wind turbines, common problems with machine data (for eg., missing data, poor quality) and how we're using this data to provide meaningful insights to our clients. We also touch upon how these insights are used - from optimizing wind turbine performance, to performing preventative maintenance.

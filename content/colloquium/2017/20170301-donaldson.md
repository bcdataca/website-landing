#### Abstract

<p>
The diversity of mathematics and roles of mathematicians in industry has
expanded greatly over the last decade.  The first part of this talk is a survey
of work that I have done as an applied mathematician working in industry.
Areas include modeling groundwater flow for soil remediation, image editing,
content-based image search, and machine learning for searching large satellite
images.
</p>
<p>
The second part of this talk will focus on a particular use
of mathematics in indexing high dimensional floating-point vectors using a
search engine intended for text.  The result is a database search method that
can combine "fuzzy" data, such as image textures or audio recordings, with
text-based data such as document titles or descriptive keywords in an
infrastructure easy for a software engineer to build and maintain.
</p>
<p>
The ultimate purpose of this talk is to highlight areas of mathematics of
particular use to my work in industry, and hence of particular interest to
future industrial practitioners.

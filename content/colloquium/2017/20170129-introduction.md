## Talk Details

### A risk-based platform for accident prevention strategies
#### Speakers: Jeff Coleman, Soyean Kim

<p>BC Safety Authority’s accident prevention strategy follows a risk based platform, called “bow tie” for ongoing management and prevention of major incidents. The bow tie method draws on the direct experience of safety management team and the data collected from various safety oversight programs in order to identify hazards and to properly incorporate critical controls into management systems. In addition, it raises awareness and improves understanding and risk knowledge of the potential major incidents and the reliance on critical controls that prevent those accidents from occurring.  Opportunities exist for greater connectivity among various databases to maximize the risk knowledge, especially the pre incident data based on inspections and post incident data.

### The Promising Future of Mathematics in Industry
#### Speaker: Roger Donaldson, Ph.D.
<p>
The diversity of mathematics and roles of mathematicians in industry has
expanded greatly over the last decade.  The first part of this talk is a survey
of work that I have done as an applied mathematician working in industry.
Areas include modeling groundwater flow for soil remediation, image editing,
content-based image search, and machine learning for searching large satellite
images.
</p>
<p>
The second part of this talk will focus on a particular use
of mathematics in indexing high dimensional floating-point vectors using a
search engine intended for text.  The result is a database search method that
can combine "fuzzy" data, such as image textures or audio recordings, with
text-based data such as document titles or descriptive keywords in an
infrastructure easy for a software engineer to build and maintain.
</p>
<p>
The ultimate purpose of this talk is to highlight areas of mathematics of
particular use to my work in industry, and hence of particular interest to
future industrial practitioners.
</p>

### High dimensional statistical inference

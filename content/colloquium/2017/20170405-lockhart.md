Unfortunately, we have had to postpone this talk until a later date. We
apologize for any inconvenience this may cause. 

#### Abstract

<p>
Penalized regression methods permit data analysts to fit models with more
adjustable parameters than data points by imposing strong prior assumptions on
the relationships between variables.  As a result classical tools of
uncertainty assessment no longer work.  I have been involved in one approach to
uncertainty assessment for problems of this sort. I will try to summarize the
issues and contrast the current approaches.

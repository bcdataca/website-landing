#### Description

As machine learning becomes more critical to businesses' core offerings, data
scientists must adapt their tools and techniques to meet business
demands. Industry data scientists can no longer run ad hoc Tensorflow or Spark
jobs against local data sets; they must now handle cloud computing, high
availability and disaster recovery, and real-time analysis. We present an
overview of the modern data science software landscape, with an emphasis on
tools data scientists can use to design a scalable and productionized machine
learning system. We will also briefly look at the future of data science
software, including GUI-based data science tools and stream processing
platforms.

#### Description

Personalized medicine has been hailed as one of the main frontiers for medical
research in this century. In the first half of the talk, we will give an
overview on our projects that use complex and big datta sets for biomarker
discovery. In the second half of the talk, we will describe some of the
challenges involved in biomarker discovery. One of the challenges is the lack of
quality assessment tools for data generated by ever-evolving genomics
platforms. We will conclude the talk by giving an overview of some of the
techniques we have developed on data cleansing and pre-processing.
